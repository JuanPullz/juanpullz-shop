N64-era vibe, Base Set nostalgia, and a clean storefront for **Graded** and **Raw** Pokémon cards.

## How to use
1. Open `cart.html` → `js/cart.js` and set `EMAIL_TO` to your address.
2. Edit `products.json` (set `"kind": "graded"` or `"raw"`; graded can include `"grader"` and `"grade"`).
3. Double‑click `index.html` to preview, then deploy to Netlify / Vercel / GitHub Pages.
